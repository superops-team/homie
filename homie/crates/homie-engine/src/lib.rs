//! The session engine: PTY ownership, output logging, and session state.
//!
//! This crate is Homie's daemon and process supervisor. Everything here is
//! written against the standard library and a thin
//! platform layer, so the parts that cannot be portable are visible as such
//! rather than diffused through the codebase.
//!
//! # Porting rules
//!
//! - **On-disk and on-wire formats are load-bearing.** A holder log must be
//!   readable byte for byte across daemon restarts and upgrades. Formats are
//!   documented where they are implemented and covered by tests that assert
//!   exact bytes.
//! - **Platform-specific code lives behind `cfg` and a named seam**, never
//!   inline in logic. Unix is implemented; Windows is a gap with a defined
//!   shape (see `pty`), not an unbounded rewrite.
//! - **No alternate daemon path.** This Engine is the single owner of
//!   background process supervision.
