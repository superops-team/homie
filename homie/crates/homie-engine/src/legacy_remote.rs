//! One-time retirement of remote sessions created by the pre-Holder transport.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Before the Holder, a remote session was an `ssh -t` into a tmux pane on the
//! host. That transport — and with it `migrate::kill_remote_tmux` and
//! `remote_tmux_session_name` — is gone. What is NOT gone is a user's state
//! file: after upgrading they still hold `SessionRecord`s with `host: Some(..)`
//! and no [`RemoteBinding`], because no Holder ever owned them. Nothing in the
//! new Engine can reach those records, so they sit in the sidebar claiming to
//! be live forever, and the tmux server on the host keeps their agents running
//! indefinitely (measured on the author's box: panes with 17 days of uptime).
//!
//! Leaving that to "the user ssh's in and cleans up" is not a migration. This
//! module is the migration.
//!
//! # This is not a tmux fallback
//!
//! `AGENTS.md` forbids tmux as a transport, a feature flag, a migration path
//! for *running* sessions, or a runtime fallback. Nothing here starts, attaches
//! to, resumes, or reads a tmux pane. The only tmux verb used is
//! `kill-session`, aimed at a name this program itself generated in a previous
//! version, exactly once per record, and never again. It is a janitor for
//! litter we dropped, not a way to run anything. When every user has launched
//! the new Engine once, this file can be deleted whole and nothing else
//! changes.
//!
//! # Safety: whose pane is it
//!
//! The old naming convention (recovered verbatim from
//! `origin/main:crates/homie-engine/src/remote.rs`) is a pure truncation, not a
//! hash: strip the `s_` prefix from the persisted session id and take the first
//! eight characters, so `s_4b99600fd4f1` became the tmux session `homie-4b99600f`.
//! A target is therefore only ever derived from a record this Engine already
//! owns, and it is additionally required to match `homie-` plus lowercase hex —
//! a record id with an unexpected shape produces no target at all.
//!
//! Two further guards matter:
//!
//! * `kill-session -t` in tmux is *not* an exact match. tmux falls back to
//!   prefix and then fnmatch matching, so a bare `-t homie-4b99600f` could take
//!   out `homie-4b99600f-something` and a target containing `*` would be a
//!   wildcard. Every target here is sent as `=name`, tmux's documented
//!   exact-match form, and shell-quoted on the way out.
//! * Panes named `homie-*` that no record refers to are **inventoried and
//!   reported, never killed**. See [`Outcome::orphan_panes`].
