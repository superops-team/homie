//! Session survival: a holder process owns each PTY so the daemon doesn't.
//!
//! The daemon crashes, upgrades, and restarts; an agent mid-task must not die
//! with it. The holder architecture separates ownership: one lightweight
//! *manager* process per registry hosts one [`server::HolderServer`] per
//! session, each owning exactly one PTY, child tree, and output log. The
//! daemon is just a client — it asks the manager to launch holders, then
//! drives each one over a per-session unix socket and tails its output log
//! from disk.
//!
//! All holder processes and protocols in the active architecture are
//! Rust-owned. The socket paths, NDJSON request/response shapes, pid-file
//! contents and in-band OSC 777 exit marker are versioned internal contracts.
//!
//! Wire protocol, per connection: one JSON request line in, one JSON response
//! line out, connection closed. No framing beyond the newline; no pipelining.
