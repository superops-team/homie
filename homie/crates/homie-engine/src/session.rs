//! A live session: one child process on a PTY, watched.
//!
//! This is where the previous layers meet. A session appends everything the
//! child writes to its [`OutputLog`], feeds the same bytes to a
//! [`HeadlessScreen`], evaluates the screen against the agent's manifest, and
//! folds the result through a [`StatusReducer`]. The current status and the
//! output log are what everything else in the product reads.
//!
//! Who owns the PTY is a transport choice. A *direct* session owns it in
//! process — simple, and gone when this process is. A *held* session's PTY
//! belongs to a holder (see [`crate::holder`]): the session is then only a
//! client and a log tail, and the child survives this process dying. Held is
//! what the daemon uses; direct remains for tests and embedded callers.
//!
//! The pump runs on its own thread rather than the async runtime, because the
//! PTY read is a blocking syscall — the same reasoning that moved the test
//! servers off the cooperative pool earlier tonight.
