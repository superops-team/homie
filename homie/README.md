# homie

For first-party VPS execution, per-node Claude/Codex accounts, fleet usage,
and transactional local↔cloud handoff, see [NODE.md](NODE.md).

`homie` is the Rust + GPUI desktop app, shipped self-contained: the app bundle
carries the daemon (`homied`), the session holders that keep agents alive
across daemon restarts and upgrades, the `homie` CLI, and the MCP proxy. The
workspace holds the protocol/client core, the session engine, terminal
renderer, shared design system, session store, usage accounting, and
window/sidebar shell. [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) is the historical record of the
port from the retired Swift client, kept for its architecture and coexistence
notes.

## Engine

Sessions are owned by *holder* processes, not the daemon: the daemon can
crash, upgrade, or be swapped out and every live agent keeps running, to be
adopted by whatever daemon starts next.

Two daemons ship in the bundle. `homied` (Swift) is the default.
`homied-rs` is the cross-platform Rust engine
([`crates/homie-engine`](crates/homie-engine)) — same socket, same wire
protocol, same on-disk state, same holders, so flipping between them never
loses a session. Opt a machine in with:

```sh
HOMIED_PATH=/Applications/homie.app/Contents/Resources/bin/homied-rs open -a homie
```

[`PORT.md`](PORT.md) tracks the port layer by layer, including the remaining
gaps that keep the Swift daemon the default for now.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask cristicretu/homie/homie
```

Or download the DMG from [the latest release](https://github.com/cristicretu/homie/releases/latest).
Either way you get the same universal build, signed and notarized, so it opens
without a Gatekeeper prompt.

The cask lives in [cristicretu/homebrew-homie](https://github.com/cristicretu/homebrew-homie)
rather than `homebrew-cask`, which requires a notability threshold the project
does not meet yet. It declares `auto_updates true`, so Homebrew installs homie
once and then leaves it alone — homie updates itself after that, and
`brew upgrade` will not clobber a build the app moved itself to. See
[UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md) for how that works.

## Toolchain and GPUI pin

- Rust: `1.95.0` (stable, pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- GPUI source: [`zed-industries/zed`](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)
- GPUI revision: [`dc2a339d5d043da448a3f7ddc7c0a85c63864aad`](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/commit/dc2a339d5d043da448a3f7ddc7c0a85c63864aad)
- Revision date: 2026-07-22

The git revision is intentionally exact. Upgrade it deliberately and update this record when doing so.

## Build and run

```sh
cargo build
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
./scripts/build.sh
```

Run the app under development through `dev.sh`, which builds a throwaway app
bundle with a commit-specific name, bundle id, window title, Dock icon, and
in-window build marker. It also removes agent-session environment variables
that would otherwise stop homie from finding or launching the shared daemon:

```sh
./scripts/dev.sh
./scripts/dev.sh --release
./scripts/dev.sh --settings remote
./scripts/dev.sh -- --features audio-playback
```

The dev and installed apps deliberately share the daemon, socket, sessions,
preferences, and Application Support directory. That makes the dev build useful
against real sessions, but do not focus the same session in both apps at
different terminal sizes: each client can resize the shared PTY.

The app uses blurred window backing, a translucent persistent-width sidebar, an opaque Homie Dark terminal card, full-size content under transparent titlebar chrome, adjusted traffic lights, and a 900×560 minimum size.

### Sidebar preview fixtures

Deterministic sidebar fixtures render without connecting to the daemon. Run any scenario with:

```sh
env HOMIE_SIDEBAR_PREVIEW=1 HOMIE_SIDEBAR_SCENARIO=typical ./scripts/dev.sh
env HOMIE_SIDEBAR_PREVIEW=1 HOMIE_SIDEBAR_SCENARIO=stress ./scripts/dev.sh
env HOMIE_SIDEBAR_PREVIEW=1 HOMIE_SIDEBAR_SCENARIO=empty ./scripts/dev.sh
env HOMIE_SIDEBAR_PREVIEW=1 HOMIE_SIDEBAR_SCENARIO=artifacts ./scripts/dev.sh
```

Preview mode uses deterministic mock dates, account identity, and usage values. It never opens a daemon connection or reads local account/transcript data.

## Remote hosts

Add, edit, or remove execution hosts from **Settings → Remote**. The catalog is
stored per installation in
`~/Library/Application Support/Homie/hosts.json`. `forge` is the current
shared host, not a built-in server type or reserved id. Each installation can
use its own SSH user and can add any number of other SSH-reachable machines:

```json
{
  "hosts": [
    {
      "id": "forge",
      "name": "Forge",
      "ssh": "you@forge",
      "defaultCwd": "~/code"
    },
    {
      "id": "studio",
      "name": "Studio Mac",
      "ssh": "studio.local",
      "defaultCwd": "~/Developer"
    }
  ]
}
```

`id` is the stable value persisted with sessions, `name` is presentation only,
and `ssh` accepts either an SSH destination or an alias from `~/.ssh/config`.
Removing the file leaves the app in local-only mode. Tailscale IPv4 addresses
and MagicDNS names work like any other SSH destination when OpenSSH can resolve
them; Homie neither requires nor configures Tailscale for Remote Holder sessions.

## Coexistence

`homie` launches the daemon bundled beside it when none is running, and
otherwise talks to whichever Rust Engine owns the socket. A packaged Engine
upgrade may replace an outdated daemon after holders have preserved their
sessions. Until the protocol gains multi-desktop geometry arbitration, do not
focus the same session in two desktop clients at different terminal sizes;
both would resize the same PTY, and input sent from both is interleaved.
