# Remote Architecture: Bootstrapped PTY Holders

## Status

The remote transport refactor is complete.

As of 2026-08-09, the bootstrapped Rust Remote PTY Holder is Homie's only remote
session transport. The former Rust `ssh -t` + `tmux` implementation, its session
naming, cleanup paths, configuration surface, tests, and runtime fallback have
been removed. Homie never falls back to `tmux`.

This document is the active architecture and maintenance baseline, not an
initial proposal or migration plan. In this document:

- **completed baseline** means the Rust-only bootstrap and PTY replacement that
  define the current remote architecture;
- **future enhancement** means optional functionality that may be built on top
  of that architecture and does not make the remote refactor incomplete;
- **Remote Helper** and **`homie-remote`** refer to the same minimal executable;
- **Holder** means the per-session process that owns the remote PTY and Agent
  process tree.

The completed execution path is:

```text
Homie desktop app
  -> local Rust Engine
  -> ssh -T binary channel
  -> short-lived remote Bridge
  -> per-session homie-remote Holder
  -> Claude Code / Codex / Shell
```

The removed path was:

```text
Homie
  -> local PTY
  -> ssh -t
  -> remote SSH PTY
  -> remote tmux PTY
  -> Agent
```

## Design priorities and hard constraints

The priority order is fixed:

1. correctness and stability;
2. performance among correct designs;
3. least privilege and the smallest remote dependency surface;
4. explicit recovery and diagnostic behavior.

Correctness is a release gate. Session identity, input delivery, PTY draining,
terminal reconstruction, process cleanup, and authentication boundaries must
not be weakened for throughput.

The implementation is entirely Rust-owned under this workspace. For remote
architecture and maintenance decisions, `Sources/`, `Package.swift`, Swift
tests, Swift daemons, Swift Holders, and Swift wire formats are treated as
nonexistent. Historical Swift behavior does not create a compatibility
requirement.

The current baseline:

- uses SSH only as an authenticated, encrypted byte transport;
- gives Homie direct ownership of the remote Agent PTY lifecycle;
- requires no remote `tmux`, `screen`, `zellij`, Node.js, Python, `socat`, `nc`,
  `curl`, `wget`, or preinstalled Homie service;
- never requests `sudo` or host-wide configuration;
- fails closed with a structured error when no valid Helper artifact or
  capability-compatible Helper is available;
- retains orchestration and user-facing state in the local Rust Engine.

## Why the old transport was replaced

`tmux` provided a practical PTY, process survival, and reconnection mechanism,
but it also imposed a remote package dependency and inserted another terminal
emulation layer:

```text
local PTY -> SSH PTY -> tmux pane PTY -> Agent
```

Each layer could alter `$TERM`, color handling, mouse events, resize behavior,
alternate-screen behavior, control sequences, and TUI layout. The local Engine
also owned only the local `ssh` process, which prevented precise observation and
control of the remote foreground process group, child processes, signals,
resource facts, and exit causes.

Homie already uses Holder processes to decouple PTY, Agent, GUI, and daemon
lifecycles locally. Applying the same ownership model remotely removes the
external multiplexer while keeping SSH-only onboarding.

## Component and authority model

### Local Rust Engine

The local Engine is authoritative for:

- `SessionRecord` and project/worktree identity;
- Agent manifests and structured launch requests;
- status reduction, including Working, Permission, Question, and Done;
- desktop broadcasts and user-visible lifecycle operations;
- host configuration and remote bootstrap orchestration;
- reconnect policy and remote failure classification;
- local-to-remote version and capability gates.

The desktop app and `homie-client` request remote operations through the Engine.
They do not execute SSH directly.

### Remote Helper

`homie-remote` is deliberately not a second Homie Engine. It owns only facts that
cannot remain local:

- one Agent PTY and process tree per session;
- the current terminal grid, cursor, modes, and dimensions;
- bounded raw output and bounded scrollback;
- output sequence and offset;
- process exit facts;
- one controller lease and its monotonically increasing epoch;
- one owner-only Unix domain socket for attachment.

The Helper exposes these subcommands:

```text
homie-remote probe
homie-remote launch
homie-remote attach
homie-remote inspect
homie-remote list
homie-remote kill
homie-remote environment
homie-remote directories
homie-remote persistence
homie-remote gc
```

Each session has exactly one independent Holder and one Unix socket. There is no
multi-session remote Homie supervisor. A Holder may spawn one minimal liveness
guard whose only responsibility is to wait for Holder pipe closure and kill
that session's Agent process group. The guard owns no PTY, socket, terminal
state, or orchestration.

### Shared Rust crates

The completed ownership boundaries are:

- `homie-engine`: local session authority, host orchestration, bootstrap, SSH,
  reconnect, and status reduction;
- `homie-proto::remote_pty`: versioned Helper protocol and wire codec;
- `homie-pty`: shared low-level PTY primitives;
- `homie-terminal-state`: shared headless parser, grid, snapshot, and diff model;
- `homie-remote`: minimal remote Helper executable;
- `homie-client`: app-to-Engine client only;
- `homie-term`: GPUI terminal rendering and input integration;
- `homie-app`: desktop UI and user actions;
- `homie-node`: optional enhanced node mode, never required by SSH bootstrap.

`homie-remote` does not depend on GPUI, `homie-app`, `homie-client`, `homie-node`, or
the full Engine. There is one shared terminal parser implementation rather than
separate local and remote parsers.

## SSH transport

Helper protocol channels use:

```bash
ssh -T
```

SSH performs authentication, encryption, remote command execution, and binary
byte transport. It does not allocate or own the Agent PTY. Helper frames have
exclusive use of protocol stdin/stdout.

OpenSSH configuration is reused. A finite-lived ControlMaster may reduce repeat
authentication and handshake cost, but it is only a performance optimization.
Session survival never depends on the ControlMaster.

All internal remote commands invoke a fixed, internally generated POSIX shell
entry point. User-controlled Agent arguments are never interpolated into shell
strings. On macOS, OpenSSH prompts are routed through the packaged Rust
`homie-ssh-askpass`; the Engine does not parse passwords or host-key answers from
the Helper protocol channel.

Overlong OpenSSH `ControlPath` values are mapped into a short owner-specific
namespace after owner, file type, and symlink validation. This avoids Unix
socket path limits without using a shared untrusted control socket.

## Bootstrap and remote environment initialization

Homie follows the useful part of Zed's remote model: establish SSH, inspect the
remote platform, install an exact server-side executable automatically, and
then speak a structured protocol. The implementation was compared against Zed
at commit `dc2a339`, but Homie keeps its own narrower Holder boundary and does
not install a full remote editor service.

Initialization is an explicit state machine:

```text
resolve host configuration
  -> establish SSH transport
  -> probe OS and CPU architecture
  -> select an exact packaged artifact
  -> probe the installed Build ID and protocol
  -> upload to a nonce staging path when required
  -> verify length and SHA-256
  -> verify Build ID, protocol, and capabilities
  -> activate with an atomic no-replace rename
  -> capture account and cwd environments
  -> probe persistence
  -> report a sanitized readiness result
```

Bootstrap is idempotent and safe under concurrent callers. An interrupted or
failed installation may remove only its own nonce staging file. It must never
delete a validated Helper or live session state.

The packaged Helper catalog is authoritative. Homie never downloads an
executable from a URL selected by the remote host and never runs an arbitrary
installer returned by the remote host. A loose Cargo build may select the exact
current Helper next to the Engine executable, but it must satisfy the same hash,
Build ID, protocol, and capability checks.

Every stateless remote management action performs a version gate. After the app
or Engine is updated, the first remote action installs the matching Helper when
necessary. The host-management UI also exposes **Reinstall Environment**, which
forces the same verified staging and activation path without overwriting or
terminating Helpers still referenced by live sessions.

Versioned Helpers coexist:

```text
~/.cache/homie/bin/
  protocol-<major>/
    <build-id>/
      homie-remote

~/.local/state/homie/sessions/
  <session-id>/
    session.json
    holder.sock
    output.log
```

Existing sessions continue to use their creation Build ID. Garbage collection
retains every Build ID referenced by a live session. A Helper is never replaced
in place.

Required permissions are:

- cache and state directories: `0700`;
- Helper executable: `0700`;
- state/log files and Unix sockets: owner-only, with regular files `0600`.

Bootstrap validates every interpolated path component and rejects untrusted
symlinks. A missing catalog entry, corrupt artifact, unsupported target, build
mismatch, or capability mismatch fails closed and never triggers a `tmux`
fallback.

## Supported platforms

The Remote Helper support matrix is deliberately limited to:

```text
Linux x86_64
Linux aarch64
macOS arm64
```

macOS x86_64 is not built, packaged, tested through Rosetta, or supported.
Intel macOS probes return `unsupported-platform`.

Linux artifacts are static musl executables and are tested in minimal/older
userspaces. The macOS artifact depends only on supported system libraries and
is validated against the minimum supported macOS version. Packaging fails when
any supported artifact is missing or its manifest metadata does not match.

## Agent launch environment

Non-interactive SSH `$PATH` is not assumed to contain `claude`, `codex`, or other
Agents. Remote tools may depend on a login shell, Homebrew, `nvm`, `mise`, or
user-local installation paths.

The Helper resolves the account login shell from the remote user database. It
captures the account-login environment and the target-cwd environment through a
dedicated file descriptor so shell startup noise cannot corrupt protocol
stdout. Capture is bounded by time and size, and failure is reported explicitly.

The local Engine sends a structured launch request containing:

- `argv` as an ordered argument vector;
- `cwd` as a separately validated absolute path;
- a filtered environment map.

The PTY child executes `argv` directly. Agent launches are never assembled by
concatenating shell text.

Local credentials, local Unix sockets, authentication responses, and local
process environment are not copied wholesale. Sensitive or irrelevant local
variables, including local-only `HOMIE_` and `SSH_` state, are removed. The
remote account and cwd environment remain authoritative, with only explicitly
allowed launch overrides applied.

## Directory and project model

The Engine provides a unified `host.list_directories` RPC. Remote directory
selection uses the exact installed Helper's read-only `directories` command;
SSH and remote path handling never move into the desktop app.

Each request lists one directory level, returns at most 512 directories, and
bounds total scanning work. The canonical path returned by the Helper is the
authority for later navigation. A host's `defaultCwd` is used only for the
initial location and never overwrites a user-selected absolute subdirectory.
The default remote directory is the account home directory (`~`) unless the
host configuration explicitly specifies another valid directory.

Project identity includes both execution location and directory. Every session
belongs to exactly one top-level Project. The same path on two SSH hosts is two
different Projects, and project-level Agent creation inherits that Project's
host and directory.

## Holder and process lifecycle

The Holder owns the PTY master, the Agent child/process group, terminal state,
controller state, and the session socket. A Bridge is a short-lived adapter:

```text
SSH stdin/stdout <-> remote Unix socket <-> Holder
```

When an SSH channel disconnects, the Bridge exits. If host policy permits
detached user processes, the Holder and Agent continue independently.

Application exit follows explicit lifecycle rules:

- with no active sessions and no other control responsibility, the app asks the
  Engine to persist and exit; idle local holder-management processes also exit;
- with a live local session, the local Engine, Holder, and Agent remain because
  they are necessary session owners;
- with a live remote session, the remote Holder, guard, and Agent remain, while
  the local Engine remains only when required for local orchestration, status,
  or an active Bridge;
- no process is retained merely to make the next app launch faster;
- cached Helpers and manifests are files, not background services;
- `homie-node` runs only when the user explicitly enables that separate mode.

First-party Claude and Codex manifests execute the Agent directly. After the
Agent exits, the Holder does not fall back into a login shell. Normal exit,
signal exit, external exit, and Holder failure are reported distinctly so the
desktop can detach the terminal and remove the corresponding Agent row. Engine
restart/adoption preserves still-running sessions.

## Persistence capability

`setsid()` or double-forking does not guarantee survival after SSH logout on
every Linux host. PAM or `systemd-logind` policy may kill all processes from a
login session.

Each host is therefore probed rather than assumed. Homie launches a temporary
Holder, closes the first SSH channel, reconnects through an independent channel,
checks the process identity, and cleans up the test session. The result is one
of:

```text
native-detach
user-supervisor
non-persistent
```

Behavior is fixed:

- `native-detach`: use the ordinary lightweight Holder;
- `user-supervisor`: use only an already available, no-configuration transient
  user supervisor;
- `non-persistent`: allow the session but display a persistent **No detach**
  warning because SSH disconnect may terminate it.

Homie never installs a service, persistent user unit, or LaunchAgent; never calls
`sudo`; never changes PAM, `sshd`, or linger configuration; and never falls back
to `tmux`.

## Terminal state and reconnection

A bounded raw output log is not sufficient to reconstruct arbitrary full-screen
terminal applications. The Holder therefore maintains authoritative terminal
state continuously:

```text
PTY bytes -> shared terminal parser -> Grid + Cursor + Modes
```

On attach, the Holder sends a `FullSnapshot`, followed by sequenced incremental
updates. A snapshot contains only the visible grid, cursor, modes, dimensions,
and sequence. Scrollback is bounded to 4 MiB and served on demand through
`Scroll`. Raw output is bounded to 32 MiB.

The PTY reader must never block on a client. The Holder uses bounded queues. It
coalesces background output for no more than 16 ms, while up to two grid
publications after interactive input bypass that wait (one trailing publication
may already be in flight before the actual response). When no client is
attached, it continues parsing terminal state but does not construct or
serialize diffs. If an attached client falls behind, stale updates are discarded
and the connection is reseeded from a complete snapshot after reconnect.

One owner/event loop handles PTY drain, terminal parsing, diff construction, and
attach writes. The hot path does not put an `Arc<Mutex<Terminal>>` across tasks.
Buffers are reused where practical, and idle Holders do not poll, heartbeat, or
run GC.

## Controller lease

The completed baseline permits exactly one live attach/controller. A new attach
atomically increments the controller epoch and revokes the previous attach.

Only the current epoch may send:

- `Input`;
- `Resize`;
- `Signal`;
- `Scroll`;
- session termination requests.

Stale epochs fail with a structured protocol error. Multiple read-only observers
are a future enhancement and are not part of the completed baseline.

## Wire protocol

`homie-proto::remote_pty` is the versioned protocol authority. Protocol 1.2
declares terminal, session management, environment capture, directory listing,
persistence probing, and atomic activation as required capabilities.

The protocol includes:

```text
Hello
HelloAck
Launch
Attach
FullSnapshot
Grid
Scroll
Modes
Input
Resize
Ping
Pong
ProcessExit
Signal
AcquireControl
ControlGranted
ControlRevoked
ReleaseControl
Error
```

All frames have hard size limits. Authentication tokens are redacted from Debug
output and cleared on drop. Encoders and decoders validate terminal dimensions,
total cell counts, cursor positions, row indices, and exact row widths before
allocation or state mutation.

The receiver rejects incompatible protocol majors, missing required
capabilities, incorrect Build IDs, wrong session incarnations, oversized frames,
and stale controller epochs. Unknown optional fields may be ignored; unknown
required capabilities fail closed. Protocol stdin is never reinterpreted as raw
terminal input after an error.

## Security and durability

The implementation must preserve these invariants:

- verify artifact length, SHA-256, Build ID, protocol, and required capabilities
  before activation;
- never overwrite a live Helper version;
- never follow an untrusted cache/state symlink;
- never log credentials, authentication responses, complete environments,
  Agent prompts, or unredacted protocol payloads;
- keep Helper frames separate from OpenSSH authentication UI;
- bind session attachment to owner-only state and authenticated bearer material;
- clean up only resources created by the failing operation;
- execute Agent arguments structurally, not through shell interpolation;
- request no elevation or host-wide configuration.

## Performance requirements

Correctness precedes performance. Among designs that preserve the invariants,
Homie prefers lower latency, CPU usage, memory use, copies, wakeups, and idle
work. A supervisor, fan-out mechanism, lock, cache, or background poller requires
measurement evidence.

Release builds must satisfy the local Helper/UDS gates:

```text
FullSnapshot p90          <= 100 ms
input-to-PTY p95          <= 10 ms
output-to-diff p90        <= 8 ms
loopback interaction p50 <= 75 ms
loopback interaction p90 <= 150 ms
```

The 2026-08-11 local release sample measured:

```text
FullSnapshot p90          0 us
input-to-PTY p95          138 us
output-to-diff p90        13 us
loopback interaction p50 76 us
loopback interaction p90 99 us
```

Measured values are printed in CI so regressions are visible rather than hidden
behind pass/fail status.

## Desktop integration

The desktop app initializes a newly added SSH host immediately and displays the
bootstrap state. The Engine returns only sanitized facts such as Build ID,
protocol version, cwd, shell, and persistence level. It does not expose the full
remote environment or authentication data to the UI.

The host editor supports environment reinstallation. Progress indicators use a
shared reduced-motion-aware component. Successful completion is transient;
failure remains visible with a retry action.

Working-tree inspection follows the session's execution location. Local paths
are inspected locally. Remote paths use a fixed no-PTY SSH script with cwd and
comparison values sent separately. Response markers isolate login-shell noise.
A non-Git directory or a host without Git is a compatible unavailable state,
not a recurring UI error.

The Engine's `Hello` includes an explicit Rust daemon identity and executable
hash. The app and client reject missing, old, or unknown daemon identities. A
confirmed Rust Engine whose hash differs from the bundled executable is upgraded
without abandoning live Holder/Agent state, ensuring subsequent remote actions
use the current Helper catalog.

## Tailscale, iPhone Companion, and `homie-node`

These features are separate from Remote Holder transport:

- Tailscale may provide network reachability, but Homie does not configure it and
  remote sessions do not depend on it;
- `homie-node` is an optional, explicitly configured enhanced mode and is not a
  bootstrap dependency;
- the old iPhone companion path is not part of the Rust remote architecture and
  its obsolete UI entry points are removed;
- any future companion implementation requires a separately designed protocol,
  security model, lifecycle, and product scope.

## Verification and release gates

Deterministic tests use fake SSH executables, fixture homes, Unix sockets, and
spawned test PTYs rather than a developer's personal remote host. Regression
coverage includes:

- noisy shell startup and environment capture timeout/failure;
- supported and unsupported platform parsing;
- concurrent and interrupted bootstrap;
- upload, launch, and attach channel interruption;
- corrupt artifacts and build/protocol/capability mismatch;
- cache symlink rejection and owner-only permissions;
- detach/reconnect with unchanged process identity and incarnation;
- terminal snapshot restoration and continued input;
- slow-attach recovery from stale diffs;
- controller lease revocation and stale writes;
- normal exit, signal exit, and Holder failure;
- directory pagination/bounds and canonical navigation;
- all three persistence outcomes;
- complete `list`, `inspect`, `kill`, and `gc` lifecycle behavior.

CI builds and executes the exact Helper artifact natively on Linux x86_64,
Linux aarch64, and macOS arm64. It also runs a disposable, ordinary-user
OpenSSH detach/reconnect soak. These are mandatory release gates and do not use
Rosetta or a developer's real SSH host.

The acceptance suite validates release-mode UDS performance, a 23 MiB slow-
attach recovery case, and transient user-supervisor behavior. The real SSH soak
verifies bootstrap, login-shell handling, persistence probing, Bridge
disconnection, same-PID/same-incarnation reconnection, snapshot restoration,
continued input, and cleanup.

An optional manual soak uses:

```bash
HOMIE_REMOTE_SSH_TARGET=user@disposable-host \
HOMIE_REMOTE_SOAK_SECONDS=180 \
scripts/remote-ssh-soak.sh
```

Optional variables are `HOMIE_REMOTE_HELPER_PATH`,
`HOMIE_REMOTE_SSH_EXECUTABLE`, and `HOMIE_REMOTE_CWD`. The test prints its unique
session ID and performs authenticated cleanup on success, assertion failure, and
panic unwind.

## Completion record

The completed refactor includes all of the following:

- removal of the Rust SSH PTY + `tmux` transport and every fallback;
- a Rust-owned, versioned Helper catalog for all supported targets;
- authenticated, bounded, capability-negotiated `remote_pty` frames;
- shared PTY and terminal-state crates used by Engine and Helper;
- one independent Holder, UDS, PTY, and process guard per session;
- nonblocking PTY drain, bounded output/scrollback, snapshot recovery, and
  controller-epoch revocation;
- remote spawn, reconnect, daemon-restart adoption, Agent resume, exit
  attribution, and authenticated attachment in the Engine;
- host initialization, exact-version environment reinstall, and automatic
  Helper synchronization after updates;
- account/cwd environment capture and structured `argv`/`cwd`/environment
  execution;
- bounded remote directory selection and host-aware project identity;
- location-aware working-tree inspection with non-Git compatibility;
- explicit persistence probing with no privilege escalation;
- native artifacts and release gates for Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64, and
  macOS arm64;
- performance, slow-client, lifecycle, bootstrap, protocol, security, and real
  OpenSSH soak coverage.

The completed acceptance scenario is:

```text
1. Start an interactive Agent on a supported remote host.
2. Disconnect the network for several minutes.
3. Reconnect to the same session incarnation.
4. Restore the authoritative terminal screen.
5. Continue interacting with the same Agent process.
```

## Deferred enhancements

The following are independent product enhancements, not unfinished remote
refactor work:

- remote Claude hooks and Codex notifications;
- offline structured Agent-event buffering;
- remote conversation/thread identifiers;
- MCP forwarding;
- artifact, port, usage, and resource discovery;
- handoff and checkpoint migration;
- cross-host or post-reboot process recovery;
- multiple read-only observers;
- deeper, explicitly configured `homie-node` integration.

Adding any of these requires an explicit proposal update. They must not enlarge
the Helper into a second Engine or weaken the current security and lifecycle
boundaries.

## Non-goals

The current architecture does not attempt to:

- replace SSH as the transport and authentication layer;
- build a complete remote Homie daemon;
- preserve Swift compatibility;
- keep a process alive across a remote machine reboot by default;
- implement a general-purpose terminal multiplexer;
- require `homie-node`;
- move the local state Engine to the remote host;
- install packages, services, or privileged host configuration;
- support Intel macOS or Rosetta for Remote Helper execution.

## Core principle

> The remote host keeps only state that cannot remain local: the PTY, Agent
> process, and current terminal screen. Session orchestration and product logic
> remain in the local Rust Engine.
