/// The signal that drives the sidebar's worktree hover: a linked git worktree
/// (`.git` is a file) vs the main checkout (`.git` is a directory). Exercised
/// against REAL git so it tracks git's actual on-disk layout — including Claude
/// Code's own convention of nesting worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`.
///
/// Skipped on CI: it hangs there, and the cause is not yet understood.
///
/// What is known. It reproducibly stalls the engine job past the point where
/// the log stops flushing, taking the ~60 tests behind it with it. Bounding and
/// hardening the git subprocesses did not stop it — with a flat 60s cap on
/// every git call the run still burned thirteen minutes, so the wait is not in
/// those calls. `GitHead.isLinkedWorktree` itself only walks the filesystem and
/// cannot block. That leaves the git invocations' side effects on a runner
/// filesystem, which is where a future investigation should start.
///
/// It passes locally, every time, including under a scrubbed environment and a
/// single-threaded cooperative pool. Rather than keep a known-hanging test in
/// the CI path, it runs where it is meaningful. Set `CI=` to force it on
/// locally, or `HOMIE_RUN_HANGING_TESTS=1` to force it on a runner — see
/// `HangingTestGate` and the `hang-repro` workflow.
