# Print where a stuck `swift test` run actually is.
#
# The engine suite spawns real PTYs, child agents and git repositories, so a
# hang can sit either in the test binary or in something it spawned. A runner
# gives you neither: SwiftPM block-buffers when stdout is a pipe, the job dies
# on its timeout, and the log's last line is wherever the buffer happened to
# flush. Guessing from that has already cost more time than it should.
#
# So: run this in the background next to the test, and after `delay` seconds it
# starts printing, on a fixed cadence until the run ends, a `ps` snapshot of the
# test binary and every descendant plus a `sample` call graph for each of them.
# A blocked call shows up by name, once, instead of being inferred.
#
# usage: scripts/sample-hung-tests.sh [delay-seconds] [passes] [interval-seconds]
#
# It exits 0 as soon as no process matches, so the normal case — the suite
# finishes long before `delay` — costs nothing and prints nothing.
